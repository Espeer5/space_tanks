**RESOURCES USED:** Internet

## Saturday May 21 11:00am - 12:30PM
**WHO:** Jack

**WHAT:** Mouse control to direct the ship to fire in a certain direction.

**BUGS:** Trouble figuring out geometry to get the correct angles with the mouse moving different directions.

**RESOURCES USED:** Help from Eddie later, internet.

## Saturday May 21 4:00 - 6:00 PM
**WHO:** Eddie

**WHAT:** Trying to fix mouse control for rotation of the ship upon click

**BUGS:** Since arc trig functions are pi periodic, I can't mfigure out the right piecewise relations to turn the right direction

**RESOURCES USED:** Lots of Desmos

## Sunday May 22 9:00 - 11:00 AM

**WHO:** Eddie and Jack

**WHAT:** Fixing the mouse control bug with arctrig

**BUGS:** None

**RESOURCES USED:** Demos graphing calculator

## Sunday May May 22 8:00 pm - 11:00 pm
**WHO:** Ryan

**WHAT:** Was figuring out how to pull data from .dat files to create the graphic and level design. Created asteroid init functions. 

**BUGS:** Out of order code. 

**RESOURCES USED:** Edward Speer. 

## Monday May 23 11:00 - 3:00 PM

**WHO:** Jack and Eddie

**WHAT:** Created a struct for different weapons that create different projectile types with different force creators for the game, and making body be represented by a list of polygons instead of one polygon

**BUGS:** The struct we made for storing weapons as colors didn't process through scene correctly because we were passing in a single pointer instead of a pointer to a pointer

**RESOURCES USED:** None

## Sunday May May 24 8:00 pm - 12:00 am
**WHO:** Ryan

**WHAT:** Used Eddie's struct implementation to create sprites so that the asteroids can have dimples to add more detail to the level design. 

**BUGS:** Out of order code.

**RESOURCES USED:** None.

## Sunday May May 24 6:00 pm - 11:00 pm
**WHO:** Ryan

**WHAT:** Created the borders for the demo and added force collisions to the walls and dynamic objects. Started working on level 2 design and finished up level design 1 with the new XMAX and YMAX ranges. 

**BUGS:** Out of order code. 

**RESOURCES USED:** Edward Speer.

## Thursday June 2 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm 
**WHO:** Eli
